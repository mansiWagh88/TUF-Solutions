## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a sorted array arr of size n, containing integer positions of n gas stations on the X-axis, and an integer k, place k new gas stations on the X-axis.

The new gas stations can be placed anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis, including non-integer positions.

Let **dist** be the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations after adding the k new gas stations.

Find the **minimum value** of dist.

Your answer will be accepted if it is within **1e-6** of the true value.

### Example 1:

**Input:** n = 10, arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,7, 8, 9, 10], k = 10

**Output:** 0.50000

**Explanation:**

- There are initially 10 gas stations from 1 to 10. We need to add 10 new gas stations.
- Place the new stations at: [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5]
- The resulting positions are: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5]
- The maximum distance between adjacent gas stations is 0.5.
- Hence, the minimum possible value of dist is 0.5.

### Example 2:

**Input:** n = 10, arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 1

**Output:** 1.00000

**Explanation:**

- One of the possible ways to place 1 gas station is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
- New Gas Station is at 11.
- Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas stations is still 1.
- Hence, the value of dist is 1.
- It can be shown that there is no possible way to add 1 gas station in such a way that the value of dist is lower than this.&nbsp;

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 10 <= n <= 5000&nbsp;
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
- arr is sorted in a strictly increasing order^&nbsp;
- 0 <= k <= 10^5

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
